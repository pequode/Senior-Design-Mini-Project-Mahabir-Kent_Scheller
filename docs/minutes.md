* * We updated our spring schedule 
* * George took over the spring task for researching the fda api
* * Brian switched over to working on the camera/barcode implementation
* * We then had to clarify our design decisons for the UI of the app on weather to use an application to help write the ui or do it ourselves
* * our decision was to write the code ourselves but look into the application builderx if we get stuck
* * George then outlined the UI using gimp a photoedting software

* 09/11/21 -- 20:00-20:30

9/13/21 -- 22:15-23:40
* * Discussed our accomplishments 
* * Brian worked on UI design for the last sprint 
* * George worked on integration of fda api calls into camera-barcode app
* * Problems with integration, we did not know how to switch screens without using states which makes our logic for the program bug out
* * Our program will have certain methods run in tandem with the app which causes errors
* * This setback has prevented us from moving on to the recipe storage part of the app and developing the firebase api
* * We decided to forgo trying to finish the full impelemtation of the app and move forward to testing firebase api
* * Our goals have changed, for friday we will have a semi working app that can interface with firebase
* * George also needs to figure out api secrets to safely push code to git
