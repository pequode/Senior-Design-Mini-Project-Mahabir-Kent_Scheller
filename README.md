#Senior-Design-Mini-Project-Mahabir-Kent_Scheller

This project focuses on building an app made with REACT native js. The app showcases the integration of a few key concepts for front end development. 
The app functions as a barcode calorie counter. The user logins to verify identy with google login services and then can scan barcodes and get corisponding calorie information. This information is then sent to a database where their total calorie intake is recored. If the user wishes they may retrieve their calories information and read their total calorie intake. 

#NOTE:

Due to an error on George's part some of Brain M's commits are missing. For much of the project(execpt in the crunch) the main code was implemented in such a way as to protect it from app-breaking changes. To accomplish this branches were made, worked on, then merged back into main. George ran into some issues with getting confused about which branches to work on so he deleted all of the merged branches. This also seems to have deleted the commit history. Because George would merge his code more often More of Brains commit Messages were lost. The minutes document in the `/docs` folder has a better account of what was contributed by each party. 

##Javascript:
For both of the contributers in this projet javascript was fairly unfimilar. This proved to be a learning curve for much of the apps development because js allows for things to be defined in so many different ways.

##React Native:
Learning the React Native Framework, even a little, was also a large challenge. The combination of a new language and setting up a common enviornment proved to be mor of an issue that was intially anticipated. 

##Agile
##API's:

##Github Workflow
- Github Secrets

##Beginings of CI/CD and automation
This project was also a good intro into the beginings of automation and the general dev-ops mindset, the agile sprints combined with the small automated testing suite helped make development easier, even if for just a short period at the end of the project.
